    "\n",
    "Probabilities are used everyday - when in Arizona do you always travel with water, at what probability of rain do you travel with an umbrella. \n",
    "\n",
    "One example is the purchase of insurance for a car or a house. When making the decision we often consider the probability or likelihood of damage or a severe event. Hoping the probability of severe damage is low we try to justify cheap insurance but often have regrets because the event materializes. Then, there are the people, who experience catastrophic events, floods, forest fire, serious car accident and are in dire need of full insurance coverage. So insurance is a balance act between the likelihood of an undesired event, risk tolerance, and how much a person is willing to pay to minimize their risk exposure. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second example is a warranty. Often when buying expensive goods the extended warranty is an additional cost, 10% of the purchase price for example. So the decision is what is the probability the device fail in the next 36 months? Dell PC insurance is $200/year for example. The warranty is amazing when stuff breaks - but a significant additional expense. "
